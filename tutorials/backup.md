### create below yaml definition of the Custom Resource to create Instance for MariaDB Backup: 

```execute
cat <<'EOF' > MariaDBBackup.yaml
apiVersion: mariadb.persistentsys/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: mariadb-backup
spec:
  # Backup Path
  backupPath: "/mnt/backup"

  # Backup Size (Ex. 1Gi, 100Mi)
  backupSize: "1Gi" 

  # Schedule period for the CronJob.
  # This spec allow you setup the backup frequency
  # Default: "0 0 * * *" # daily at 00:00
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
EOF
```

Execute below command to create MariaDBBackup instance:

```execute
kubectl create -f MariaDBBackup.yaml -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```


Output:

```
backup.mariadb.persistentsys/mariadb-backup created
```

This CR will schedule backup of MariaDB at defined schedule.The Database backup files will be stored at location: '/mnt/backup'. 
This location '/mnt/backup' should be created before applying the CR. 

To Ensure that cronjob is configured correctly, run below command:


```execute
kubectl get cronjob -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```

ou should see a similar output as below:


```
NAME             SCHEDULE    SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
mariadb-backup   0 0 * * *   False     0        <none>          17m
```

At scheduled interval, a new Job will start to take database backup and create a backup file at defined location (default: /mnt/backup)
